Navigate to the program directory and run the program using one of the following arguments:

-ts INTEGER

(Trains the perceptron until the weight vector remains stable for the entered number of iterations.)

-tf INTEGER

(Trains the perceptron for the entered number of iterations, regardless of weight vector stability.)

-p INTEGER

(Plots the results of the Perceptron's classification accuracy. Uses the tf mode for the entered number of iterations.)
